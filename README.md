# COVID-19 Tracker and Health Assistant

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm, and countries are devising various policies and processes to combat the deadly virus. For a densely populated and large country like India, the challenges are manifold. Infectious epidemiologists play a vital role in managing disease spread. To support them and offer a self-protecting tool to everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a cross-platform app to track infected persons using their location history.

## Features
- **Contact Tracing**: Track individuals who had contact with infected persons.
- **Travel History**: Retrieve the travel history of primary contacts.
- **Covid Self-Assessment**: Provide a question-based self-assessment for users.
- **Hotspot Alerts**: Alert users about COVID-19 hotspots and the importance of wearing masks.
- **Home Medication**: Offer home medication advice for minor health issues like headaches and finger cuts.
- **Patient Monitoring System**: Make patient monitoring more flexible.

## Technologies Used
- **Firebase**: For real-time database and authentication.
- **Geofencing API**: To track location and movement.
- **Android**: Development platform for the application.

## Purpose
This application aims to create social awareness about the need for precautionary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. It can also be useful in managing the spread of other diseases, not just the current global situation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up Firebase and Geofencing API.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device.
